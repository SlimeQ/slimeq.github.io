# Knowledge Base — Quincy Campbell (Portfolio + Resume)

Purpose: a single source of truth for links, claims, and citations used in the portfolio/resume. Keep everything **verifiable** and **scoped to what Quincy personally did**.

---

## 0) Rules of thumb

- Don’t claim ownership of a whole company’s output (no “we built 50+” unless it’s explicitly **you**).
- Prefer **primary sources** (official program pages, app store listings, product pages).
- Add **press** as corroboration (Guardian/WIRED/etc.) but don’t rely on it for technical claims.
- If something is **delisted**, say so and link to an archive/mirror explicitly.

- Decide whether to add screenshots/thumbnails for shipped apps (improves credibility).
- If Brandgage wants PDF: export resume PDF alongside DOCX.
